# Signature Work Portfolio

## Overview
This portlio is my senior capstone final project. In this portfolio, you will find data and computer science projects showcasing my experience through my time as a CISC major at St. Thomas. A few examples include samples of my data analysis, coding, and software design experience. Altogether, they showcase my ability to problem-solve, using real-world data and utilizing software systems. Throughout my time in the CISC curriculum, here are some of my projects that I feel showed this the most.

## College Football Linear Regression Analysis
https://github.com/leav9102/College-Football-Research

I chose to implement this project because it demonstrates my ability to apply statistical methods to real-world data while adhering to research guidelines. Using RStudio and R, I conducted linear regression on college football variables to predict win outcomes. This project was meaningful because it enhanced my skills in research planning, data cleaning, statistical modeling and technical writing. It was useful to write in the computer science and data science context, given that writing in this discipline is crucial in research contexts.

## Star Wars Data Visualization
https://github.com/leav9102/Star-Wars-Viz

In this project, I used R and RStudio to load and clean a dataset, create a visualization, and communicate it orally and written. The visualization ended up being how the "Favorability of Darth Vader is much higher for viewers of Star Wars Episode III". I chose to implement this project because it shows my improvement in my ability to choose a dataset, and tell an interesting story about the data. This is essential in industry and academia, because telling this story about the data can be powerful. When using these visualizations in a presentation, you can educate an audience about a topic, and it highly depends on the quality of the visualization.

## GymPal Software
https://github.com/leav9102/GymPal-CISC-450/tree/leav9102_capstone

I chose to implement this project because it was useful learning how to do version control, program an application in Python, design a database, and query data from that database. Our database stored user data, workout data, and friend data. The Python script that I wrote ran an interface in the terminal where you could choose options, enter workout data, and view leaderboards. This project was very impactful on me because I am interested in HCI and health informatics, and this was an example of practicing this. Planning this software with a team, and working together aligns with the St. Thomas mission of thinking critically and advancing the common good because this project is meant to help people exercise.
